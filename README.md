Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or newer
pip (Python package manager)
MongoDB
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

Installation

Clone the repository or download the source code:
Copygit clone <repository-url>
or download and extract the ZIP file.
Navigate to the project directory:
Copycd <project-directory>

(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
Copypython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:
Copypip install -r requirements.txt


Configuration

Open app.py and update the following configuration variables:
pythonCopyapp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
app.config['MONGO_URI'] = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database'
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your_email@gmail.com'
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_email_password'
Note: It's better to use environment variables for sensitive information in a production setting.
If you're using Gmail for the password reset feature, you may need to:

Enable "Less secure app access" in your Google Account settings, or
Use an "App Password" if you have 2-factor authentication enabled



Running the Application

Ensure MongoDB is running on your system.
From the project directory, run:
Copypython app.py

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000

Features

User Registration
User Login
Password Reset via Email
Add Contact Information
Search Contacts by Registration Number

Troubleshooting

If you encounter a "Connection refused" error, make sure MongoDB is running.
If the password reset email is not sending, check your email configuration and ensure less secure apps are allowed (for Gmail).
For any import errors, ensure all requirements are installed: pip install -r requirements.txt

Security Considerations

Use HTTPS in a production environment.
Store sensitive information like SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, and email credentials as environment variables.
Implement rate limiting for login attempts and password reset requests in a production setting.
Regularly update dependencies to patch any security vulnerabilities.

Deployment
For deploying to a production environment:

Set up a production-ready MongoDB instance.
Use environment variables for all sensitive information.
Use a production-ready web server like Gunicorn instead of Flask's built-in server.
Consider using platforms like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS for hosting.

Remember to never commit sensitive information like passwords or secret keys to version control.
